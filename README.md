Short review of the project: https://youtu.be/aFuF5dMFcTI

I Wanted to add much more mechanics to the game buuut i abolutely ran out of time.
Many of the features are made in blueprints, especially abilities because they are made using GAS. Base-classes are C++ tho.

- character cannot die on this project so its easy to see what happens when u advance
there is no much to see tho:

- 3 different enemies
- 2 weapons that give ability to character
- weapons reserve mana as ammo

I didn't have time to make little adjustments so the game feels little buggy and have annoying functionalities, BUUT good they are little bugs.
